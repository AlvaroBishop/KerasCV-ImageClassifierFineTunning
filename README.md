# Image Classifier Transfer Learning Fine Tuning using KerasCV
## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of building an image classifier using transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the Keras library, specifically leveraging KerasCV functionalities. The goal is to create a robust image classifier for a specific task by taking advantage of a pre-trained model's knowledge and adapting it to the target domain.
## Kaggle Notebook
You can also access the notebooks and run the code on Kaggle directly. Here is the link to the Kaggle notebook: [KerasCV Image Classifier Fine Tuning.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alvarobishop/kerascv-imageclassifierfinetunning)

Feel free to explore, run the code, and adapt it to your specific needs. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
